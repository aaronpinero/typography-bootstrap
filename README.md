# Tyfy for Bootstrap

_this is a pre-release package for testing_

Tyfy for Bootstrap is a themed version of Bootstrap 4. The tools for modular scale, baseline grid, and intelligent margins from the Tyfy framework are combined Bootstrap's grid system and user interface components.

Tyfy for Bootstrap has been created according to Bootstrap's theming guide. Modules from the Tyfy framework add variables and functions that are used to help customize Bootstrap's SASS variables.

Tyfy for Bootstrap overrides some Bootstrap styles to help Tyfy blend harmoniously with Bootstrap's components. The result is theme that can be applied to an existing Bootstrap 4 project with little or no change to the HTML structure or class attributes.
