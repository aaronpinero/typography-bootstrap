# Tyfy Bootstrap v1.1.0

> “Peanut butter and jelly, Riggs and Murtaugh, Sonny and Cher, Tyfy and Bootstrap 4”

Tyfy Bootstrap (TYBS) is a themed version of Bootstrap 4. The tools for modular scale, baseline grid, and intelligent margins from the [TYFY framework](http://aaronpinero.net/tyfy/docs/index.html) are combined with Bootstrap's grid system and user interface components.

TYBS has been created according to [Bootstrap's theming guide](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/theming/). Modules from the TYFY framework add variables and functions that are used to help customize Bootstrap's SASS variables.

TYBS overrides some Bootstrap styles to help TYFY blend harmoniously with Bootstrap's components. The result is theme that can be applied to an existing Bootstrap 4 project with little change to the HTML structure or class attributes.
